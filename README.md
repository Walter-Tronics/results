## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While working through this project, I figured out how easy it was displaying items with flex, not to mention how easy it is making it responsive with flexbox.

```html
<div>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Some HTML code I'm proud of</p>
</div>
```
```css
div{
  display: flex;
}
```

```css
@media (max-width:765px){
    div{
        flex-wrap:wrap;
       }
}
```
